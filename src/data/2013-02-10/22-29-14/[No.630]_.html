		<div class="date">Saturday February 9, 2013</div>	
	<div class="entry"><p>So, the news is that Nevada's casinos, the only place you can legally place sports bets, took in $98.9 million in action on the Super Bowl. Most of that was on San Francisco at -3.5 points (laying $11 to win $10). Of course there was plenty of money on the Ravens, but not as much, and there were plenty of important "prop" bets, like who would score the first touchdown, and who would win the coin toss (honest!). If you don't think that prop bet is funny, consider the fact that I once bet that William "The Refrigerator" Perry, a defensive lineman, would score an offensive TD in the Super Bowl. Even funnier is that he did!</p>

<p>At any rate, the casinos managed to hold about $7.2 million, which is a pretty big chunk of change for any sporting event. In fact, making bets in the sports book is one of the <a href="http://casinogambling.about.com/od/moneymanagemen1/a/Top-Five-Casino-Bets.htm" zT="1/1UH">top five casino bets</a> for players, based on what the casino is able to hold from what the players actually wager. Remember, it's not always what the odds of the game are or the house edge, it's what the casino wins in the long run.</p>

<p>My own experiences have been pretty good in the sports book, if you don't count my NFL regular season football bets. Or my hockey bets, which is just a crazy game to bet because sometimes they don't even have a season, and when they do, you can't find the games on TV. Oh, and I don't do too well betting the NBA, or college basketball. And, don't count my results for horse racing, even though I once bet $70 on a long-shot to win the Kentucky Derby (Alysheba) and the horse actually won! Of course I only knew about the horse because my friend in the sports book gave me the tip (Thanks again, man). So basically, I can only beat baseball. Bummer!</p></div>

		<h2><a href="http://casinogambling.about.com/b/2013/02/06/reading-at-the-poker-table.htm" zT="1/1jS">Reading at the Poker Table</a></h2>
		
		<div class="date">Wednesday February 6, 2013</div>	
	<div class="entry"><p>A while back I spent several days playing poker at the Monte Carlo casino in Las Vegas. The room's atmosphere is laid-back, with nine or ten tables, and the $1-$2 no-limit Texas Holdem game had just the right mix of players: half unsuspecting newbies, half know-it-all expert twenty-somethings who really had been playing for weeks! Great game. I was staying at the Cosmo, up the street, but the Monte Carlo is an M Life casino (MGM Resorts), and they had really low hotel rates if you played for five hours. All good stuff. The best part was watching the players watch everything but the game they were in.</p>

<p>My favorite session was where three players on my game were reading. No kidding. Two were reading Card Player, and the third was involved in a novel. He'd look at his two cards, and then toss them virtually every hand. It was easy to surmise he was playing only big slick and top pairs, but he still got action when he raised - but not from me. In addition to the readers, there was some very exciting ESPN news that hadn't been seen on TV for almost 15 minutes, so that took attention away from the poker too. Honestly, it was like playing poker with nine people with no short-term memory. Hysterical and profitable.</p>

<p>I'm really happy that today's players take such great joy in reading and watching TV at the table. Sure makes the games easier. I will admit that I used to read during my sessions, but I used to walk outside and sit in my car for twenty minutes for a break and it always helped. You can still do that at some clubs in California, but parking along the Strip isn't what it used to be. Believe it or not, you used to be able to park right in front of clubs like the Stardust and the Desert Inn, and walk 100 steps into the poker room!</p>

<b>And Speaking of Reading</b>

<p>I just got finished reading <em><a href="http://casinogambling.about.com/od/casinoreading/fr/1536.htm" zT="1/1UH">1536 Free Waters and Other Blackjack Endeavors</a></em> by Glen Wiggy. It too, took me back a few years to when I started playing blackjack (again, parking right in front of the casinos instead of in an 8-story garage) in Las Vegas. That was the best part of the book for me! The reading is fun and light, with some humor thrown in, like Spam into a skillet - weird and fatty.</p>

<p>Wiggy was a probability and statistics instructor at the Air Force Academy and a sometime poker and blackjack player when a student started quizzing him about blackjack. Turns out the student knew more about practical blackjack play then the instructor did, but that changed soon enough. Before long, Wiggy was playing everyday, over 800 sessions, and walking out of the casinos with cash, chips, and 1536 bottled waters.</p>

<p>The book presents an overview of blackjack from casual play to basic strategy and a simple plus minus count so the reader gets grounded in a little theory before embarking on any actual play. Wiggy is just funny enough to hold readers through the 200+ page book filled with sessions, sarcasm, and stories about his family. If you're new to casino blackjack, you might want to take a look. The casino interaction and learning curve ring true!</p></div>

		<div class="date">Thursday January 31, 2013</div>	
	<div class="entry"><p>There are so many slot manufacturers like WMS, IGT, Konami, and many others, that the plethora of new games is almost overwhelming. I miss the older video poker games. Even the early games with terrible odds that had both high hand and low ball games on them. Eventually (yeah, like about a million other people) I moved on to triple play. I try every new game that comes out, and fortunately or unfortunately, I was dealt a four-of-a-kind on the second or third had I played on a triple play machine and I was hooked.</p>

<p>I still play some single-line Joker Poker and Deuces Wild on progressive banks when the jackpots get high enough and I can still get a seat, but I'm also warming up to some other games like <a href="http://casinogambling.about.com/od/slotsandvideopoker/a/How-To-Play-Ultimate-X-Video-Poker.htm" zT="1/1UH">Ultimate X</a> Video Poker. I have one of those beginner's luck stories with that game too, as I managed to hit four deuces on the Deuces Wild game after just a few minutes of play, so again, I was already probably hooked, but then I got a 4x line and  hit four deuces again! That kind of luck always makes for a good evening.</p>

<p>The drawback to playing Ultimate X is that you are betting twice as much as you usually do, and your bankroll can get whacked pretty quick. However, as my case proves, sometimes you just get lucky. I was also pretty lucky on "Dream Card," where the machine randomly gives you the perfect card as your fifth, before the draw. That game is pretty cool when you are running good, but again, your paying extra and hoping to have something big hit. I had a big night with the dream card while hitting two royals, but my luck has definitely gone the other way since then and every dream has been a nightmare!</p>

<p>Have you got a favorite video poker game or a bank of games at a favorite casino? Let me know, I'll compare notes - maybe we've been feeding the same games! Maybe we should let the other readers know where some good old game still exist!</p></div>

		<div class="date">Tuesday January 29, 2013</div>	
	<div class="entry"><p>Poker Stars is closing in on their deal to purchase the <a href="http://casinogambling.about.com/b/2012/12/20/atlantic-city-trying-to-turn-a-corner.htm" zT="1/1UH">Atlantic</a> casino along the Eastern Shore. Atlantic City is holding steady in gaming revenue, but dropping on the list of the most popular US destinations. The addition of Poker Stars as a casino owner will have many repercussions, including their ability to broker some kind of a deal (no pun intended) for online poker, whether it is intra or inter-state commerce.</p>

<p>Most poker sites have been very careful about keeping US customers off their player lists, but there are still a few that are skirting the laws and hoping for the best. In addition, there are also a few online casinos and at least one successful poker site that are using <a href="http://casinogambling.about.com/od/Othercasinogames/a/Online-Casinos-And-Betting-Bitcoins.htm" zT="1/1UH">bitcoins</a> as their main exchange medium.</p>

<p>Switch Poker bills itself as the iPhone, iPad and Android Poker site of choice, and started their live online play with bitcoin exchange. They now accept Visa, Skrill, Neteller and bitcoin, but do not accept players from the US. Although many poker sites want to tap into the huge US market by providing a medium of transaction that is not bank or government regulated (the bitcoin), no site is currently safe from the US Department of Justice looking out for the safety of US citizens by keeping us from playing poker, so don't expect online poker in the near future, regardless of how close legislation has seemed to be in the past!</p>
