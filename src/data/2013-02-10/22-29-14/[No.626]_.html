A huge blizzard blasted the Northeastern United States last night and this morning. I'm watching the local news and they are reporting on the rescue of over a hundred people who were stranded in the cars for at least 12 hours. When the reporter asked them why they were out when officials warned people to stay off the roads, almost all of them said they were either getting to or home from work.
</p>

<p>
First of all, what makes an employer demand their workers come into work or stay there until it is no longer possible to get home safely? They interviewed a county legislator who said that people should have left work early or refused to go in, despite what their bosses said. I'm not sure if she realizes that there are bosses who wouldn't hesitate to fire someone for doing that, however hard that is to believe. Still, what's even more difficult to believe is that people would risk their lives to keep their jobs. What would you do? Would you defy your employer's demand or would you risk your life?

I was part of the first generation of home video game owners. I was in middle school when my parents bought me a small home system on which I could play an electronic tennis game that involved hitting a white ball back and forth with two white lines. Fun times! I can actually remember when video games didn't exist, but I would bet that no 20 or 30-something can.
</p>

<p>
The generation that grew up playing <a href="http://careerplanning.about.com/od/occupations/a/videogamecareer.htm" zT="1/1UH">video games</a> is now making them. What video game enthusiast hasn't dreamed of one day designing games himself or herself? While there aren't many entry-level video game design jobs, there are other jobs available for people just starting out in this field. The video game industry is booming. Those who are interested in working in the video game industry can consider careers in programming, audio engineering and animation. There are also business-oriented jobs, for those who want to work on that end of things.

		<div class="date">Thursday February 7, 2013</div>	
	<div class="entry"><p>
Do you want a high paying job but don't want to earn a college degree? You may be able to do it, but it's going to take a lot of effort. Every other year the US Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) publishes a list of the highest paying jobs, based on median annual earnings. Among them you will find some that <i>seem</i> to only require a high school diploma. Don't be fooled. While the highest level of education you need may be a high school diploma, don't think you can just start earning big bucks right after graduation.
</p>

<p>
With only your high school diploma, no experience and no training, you will be eligible for an entry-level job. This is how you will get the experience you need to get hired for many of the jobs listed among the <a href="http://careerplanning.about.com/od/exploringoccupations/tp/hi_pay_nodeg.htm" zT="1/1UH">highest paying</a> ones. Once you secure that first job, it is likely you will need to go through lots of on-the-job training and possibly some classroom instruction. You may even need to pass a licensing or certification exam. Then, when you have done all that, you will probably have to work for several years to gain experience. Be aware that many of the applicants who you will be competing against for those "high paying, no degree required jobs" will in fact have  college degrees or will have at least taken some college courses. Ask people who are knowledgeable about the career field you are considering what the "real requirements" are, and, if you truly want to work in that field, decide if you are willing to go all out to make yourself a competitive candidate.
</p>

<p>
I would be remiss if I didn't remind you to look beyond how much an occupation pays when deciding whether it is right for you. Remember to do your homework, which should include <a href="http://careerplanning.about.com/od/exploringoccupations/a/exploration.htm" zT="1/1UH">researching the occupation</a> and <a href="http://careerplanning.about.com/cs/aboutassessment/a/assess_overview.htm" zT="1/1UH">learning about yourself</a>, in order to decide whether it's a good fit for you.

		<div class="date">Wednesday February 6, 2013</div>	
	<div class="entry"><p>
High school and college students looking for work usually seek jobs that have flexible schedules. They need to work when they aren't in classes and in jobs that require few skills. Fast food restaurants usually offer opportunities that fit the bill. Fast food workers receive short term on-the job training. They take orders from customers, assemble some items and collect payment. They keep dining areas clean by clearing tables, emptying garbage cans, sweeping, and mopping or vacuuming floors. While job growth in this field will only be as fast as the average for all occupations through 2020, high turnover will create many job openings  (Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Department of Labor, <i>Occupational Outlook Handbook</i>, 2012-13 Edition).
